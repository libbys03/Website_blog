        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>
            In the first class, we discussed how the course will run and outlined the course. It was really useful learning about what will be covered in the course. This first class made me feel excited to get cracking into learning about how to create a functioning website, which I have never really dabbled with before. We did some icebreakers like making a name tag which was fun. I really want to delve deep into how to create a functioning website in this course as it will; help to broaden my skills in the future which I want to do.

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>
            In the second class, we went into depth of what all of the assignments require. We then split into breakout rooms and came up with a persona as practice for the first assignment. We collectively came up with Charlie, a 60-year-old man whose son had disappeared and fled the country to join a cult. There were other parts to the story as well. Even though the storyline of Charlie was very out there it was still a really fun task to get an insight on what we were thinking of creating for assignment one. I found it really helpful listening to the feedback that the tutors gave everyone on their person as it helped to refine what was required for a persona for the first assignment. In this class we also went over some HTML basics which helped just to get an idea of what we will be learning, I’ve already learnt some of it in my internet and social media class so it was good to revisit it again.

    <h2>Week Three</h2>
    <p>
        Something that I found really interesting about this class was learning about the million-dollar homepage. I had never heard of it and found it to be a genius idea to sell 10x10 pixels for a minimum of $100 each. We also did a class exercise of making a ven diagram for someone for when we come to make our websites. This was incredibly helpful because it helped me refine my ideas and learn more about the ven diagram task which I was slightly unsure about at first.

    <h2>Week Four</h2>
    <p>
        This week we looked at the history of web design from 2009 to the present day. It was mindblowing how in such little years the website industry has expanded and become far more complex. When talking about the upcoming project Haowei expanded on the customer journey map and the user flow. I hadn’t ever put much thought into these two things before so it was really helpful having them elaborated on. I really appreciate that there were examples for both as it’s helpful to refer back to when creating my own to make sure I’m on the right track.

    <h2>Week Five</h2>
    <p>
        This week was a really worthwhile class as I got an overall idea of how everyone was going on their projects it was also really helpful getting feedback on my project so far to know what the next steps would be. I had a better idea of the differences between the journey map and the user flow which is going to help me with moving forward. I also learnt more about CSS in the coding lecture which I found helpful when it comes to me actually creating a website.

    <h2>Week Six</h2>
    <p>
        This week we looked at the properties behind Colours and Typography, what fonts are good for the different aesthetics and feeling you want to provoke through the websites made. We did a group activity of critiquing a website and choosing what worked well and what needed improving. The candle website had many clear flaws throughout the site such as poor use of boldness in text, where images were placed and the overall flow of the website. This exercise was really helpful because it was clear what makes a good website and how a small flaw in a site can change the overall feel of the website so it is important to keep it consistent.

    <h2>Week Seven</h2>
    <p>
        I found it really interesting to learn about mental models in this lecture. I hadn’t heard of it before but I think that it’s something that I will keep in mind when designing a website. It was helpful getting to see everyone else's wireframes because it gave me a bit of an insight into the different takes people had on the tasks which was useful in refining my wireframes. We also looked at the composition of images and text on a website which was a nice introduction to how grids can be useful when making a website.

    <h2>Week Eight</h2>
    <p>
        In this week's lecture, I found it really helpful to have the brief for Assignment 2.2 explained. It really helped me to decide whether I wanted to do CMS or Coding for this assignment. I’ve decided that it’s going to be easier for me to create a website using CMS as I don’t feel as comfortable using coding and would like to work alongside this project working on my Coding skills so that when it comes to creating the blog I have a better idea of how to create a functioning website using coding. I’ve decided to also use the tool of Editor X to create this website as I’ve used it previously in other courses and am more familiar with it as opposed to other website-building sites.

    <h2>Week Nine</h2>
    <p>
        I really loved this week's website of the week in particular, ‘Autex Acoustics’. I love the way that the website is minimalistic but still has a seamless flow when scrolling through the website. This week we looked at responsive design and how to create a website that can be viewable through an iPad, laptop and a phone for example. Changes in a design need to be made in order for this to work accordingly. I also learnt about file organisation and how important it is, this is a useful tool when it comes to organising any files it makes it easier to access what you are looking for more efficiently and can also be beneficial when showing clients your work, it makes it easier for everyone involved.

    <h2>Week Ten</h2>
    <p>
        This week we went through some blog demonstrations from the tutors on what and what not to do for creating the blog. I’m almost finished with my website creation in Editor X, I’m just struggling to make the website responsive. I wish that I altered each format as I went rather than leaving it all the end which is what I have done so it’s harder now to make it responsive with text all over the page and overlapping. I’m overall happy about how it’s all coming together though. I’ve made a lot of changes to my website compared to my original idea which I created on Figma. This new website is easier to navigate and not as cluttered on the home screen which is what is required to make it seamless for people to click through.

    <h2>Week Eleven</h2>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, I couldn’t be in class this week due to having an appointment at the same time as class so I handed in a prerecorded video of me talking about my presentation. I’m feeling nervous about starting to code my blog as I have watched most of the coding lectures but need to refer back to most of them. I want to create a blog that is seamless and scrolls through all of the dairy entries easily. I think that this next project will consist of a lot of trial and error in order for me to create something that I’m happy with.

    <h2>Week Twelve</h2>
    <p>
        This was the last class of this course, we looked back at what we learned every week and looking back I think that this course has been extremely beneficial to the skills I have now gained. Prior to joining this course, I didn’t know anything remotely close to knowing how to create a website but now I have the basics under my belt which I can now use when coding my blog and making websites in future. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed this course and would highly recommend someone else to take it. The only downfall I have about this course is that I would prefer to have an in-person class because ethos way you can connect with peers, show eachother your work so far and have a relationship with the lecturer and tutors which I felt was lacking with the course being over Zoom.
